# Type One Diabetics Around Me
Repository to build application to receive help for local people who has diabetes type one

Explain the needs

Hi, I'm Matteo and I'm type one diabetics from more than 10 years... 
I love travel and my disease forces me to bring a lot of instruments to survive (like syringes, Insulin, pricked, needles etc)
It can happen that sometimes I forgot something or something doesn't work as expected (like insulin when there are 30 or more degrees)
So in this case if I'm near my home I can come back and heal me, but if I'm on holidays or in working travel it could be hard to survive.
The standard path is go to the closest Hospital and wait some hours to get treatment...
As I'm a programmer my intention is create a simple application where al diabetics save their domicile and when someone need help can send a "help notification" to people who live in the same area where it is located.
Now I'm starting with this repository to collect the requirements and formulate an idea of simple application.

Feel free to help me. 

This project is fully open source and my intention is to help the diabetics community.
